It Snowed in Egypt but the Snow-Covered Sphinx Photograph is a Hoax

This photograph of the Sphinx in Giza, Cairo, has gone viral, after Egypt's biggest snow storm in more than 100 years hit the country. There is one problem to it though â€“ it wasn't taken in Egypt.

This tweet below, for instance, has been retweeted almost 7,000 times and favourited more than 4,000 times:

Egypt's first snow in 100+ years covers the Sphinx. Think about it: this is likely the FIRST picture of this EVER! 

Egyptian Mona Eltahawy spills the beans:

The Sphinx in the snow pic is not from #Egypt, people. It's from a theme park in #Japan.

And Mother Jones agrees that the photograph is indeed fake.

The fiasco following the fake Sphinx photograph has left the Twittersphere suspicious of snow pictures from Egypt.

This Planet Earth photograph is put to the test:

For the first time in 112 years, snow has fallen across #Egypt !!!
